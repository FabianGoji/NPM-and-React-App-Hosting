                            NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node. js. NPM allows you to install and manage packages, or collections of code written by other developers, that can be easily reused in your own project.

                            React builds user interfaces, especially for web application React is a JavaScript library. It is an efficient way of updating and rendering components in response to data changes, thus making it best suited to creating interactive and dynamic UIs.

As such, the key features include its component-based structure that allows developers to build encapsulated UI elements that can be composed together to make complex interfaces. Furthermore, React utilizes a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) which makes rendering more efficient by reducing direct manipulation of the real DOM, which can be resource-heavy.

React encourages declarative programming where developers describe how the UI should look based on the state of an application in contrast to imperatively modulating the steps involved in updating the UI. This helps code become easier to understand, maintain and debug.

Moreover, React has a vast array of tools and libraries that support it including react router for navigation management, redux for managing application state, react native for using react syntax when building mobile apps.

Consequently, because of its performance flexibility as well as developer-friendly attributes React has emerged as one of the most preferred platforms for building modern web applications.

                        Together, NPM is installed with Node.js, which means you have to install Node.js to get NPM 
                        installed on your computer. Node version managers allow you to install and switch between 
                        multiple versions of Node.js and NPM on your system. Before installing Node.js and NPM, 
                        you should install a Node version manager. The standard is <a href ="https://github.com/creationix/nvm" target="_blank">nvm</a>.
                        You can download Node.js from the official web site <a href ="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org</a>, 
                        which also has instructions to run the install.

                        A dependency is a relationship between two pieces of software where one piece of software relies on the other to function properly. 
                        Use dependencies to define the external packages or modules that your project needs to run properly. These external packages can 
                        be libraries, frameworks, tools, or any other module that your code relies on to function correctly.

                    <p>
                        In the package.json file, dependencies consist of all the packages used in the project with the version number. By specifying 
                        these dependencies in the package.json file, you can ensure that anyone who downloads or clones your project has all the 
                        necessary packages and dependencies installed. When you uninstall an NPM package, you also remove the package from the dependencies

                        NPM scripts are commands that can be run in the terminal to initiate an action. Defining these terminal commands in your package.json 
                        file can help automate the process. This is done by making a field called “scripts” and adding entries that detail the command name and 
                        subsequent action to be performed. Development tasks are often repetitive, so being able to duplicate them across projects or be cloned 
                        by other developers is important. The “introduction to npm scripts” article published by GeeksforGeeks explains that “NPM scripts are 
                        used to automate tasks like minifying CSS, uglifying JavaScript, building project.

                        NPM scripts are versatile and simple and by learning fewer tools, we can automate tasks in our web project.” When writing your entries 
                        in the scripts field, its best to stick to traditional terms for commands that perform universal actions. By this we mean tasks that are 
                        routine and standardized. Its import to use commonly recognized terms because other developers kind use them more intuitively; additionally, 
                        devOps and instrumentation tools are better utilized with consistent script names. Note: If you make a default package.json file, then the 
                        scripts field will be automatically populated with the necessary scripts needed, but you will need to adjust the details of their actions for your project.

                        Running your scripts is done through the terminal, and can be done by entering
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <span class="green_type">npm run [script name]</span>

                    <p>
                        You can run commands for testing, launching, or displaying content but can also nest commands within each other. 
                        For example, the following entry defines the ‘start’ command as another command to run “lite”.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="green_type">
                            “scripts”:<br>
                                “start”: “npm run lite”,<br>
                                “lite”: “lite-server”<br>   
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        So you could run the command “lite” by entering “npm start” in the terminal.
