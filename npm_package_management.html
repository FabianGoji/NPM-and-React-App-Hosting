                            NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node. js. NPM allows you to install and manage packages, or collections of code written by other developers, that can be easily reused in your own project.

                            "React hosting" is the essential process of taking a React.js application—a JavaScript library highly favored for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces—and making it accessible over the internet by deploying it onto web servers provided by hosting services. This process involves several key steps. Initially, developers craft their application using React.js, leveraging its component-based architecture to structure their user interface and manage application state efficiently. Once the application is developed, it undergoes optimization for production, which entails tasks such as minimizing file sizes, bundling JavaScript files, and removing development-specific code to enhance performance and load times. Following optimization, developers must select a hosting provider from a range of options available, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Heroku, Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. Each hosting provider offers different features, scalability options, and pricing models, so the choice depends on the specific requirements of the project. Once a hosting provider is chosen, the deployment process begins. This typically involves uploading the optimized build files to the hosting provider's servers and configuring settings such as domain names, SSL certificates, and server configurations to ensure smooth operation of the application. After deployment, developers must monitor the application's performance, handling any issues that may arise, and scaling hosting resources as needed to accommodate increasing traffic and usage. Through React hosting, developers can bring their React.js applications to life on the web, enabling users worldwide to access and interact with their creations seamlessly.

                        Together, NPM is installed with Node.js, which means you have to install Node.js to get NPM 
                        installed on your computer. Node version managers allow you to install and switch between 
                        multiple versions of Node.js and NPM on your system. Before installing Node.js and NPM, 
                        you should install a Node version manager. The standard is <a href ="https://github.com/creationix/nvm" target="_blank">nvm</a>.
                        You can download Node.js from the official web site <a href ="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org</a>, 
                        which also has instructions to run the install.

                        A dependency is a relationship between two pieces of software where one piece of software relies on the other to function properly. 
                        Use dependencies to define the external packages or modules that your project needs to run properly. These external packages can 
                        be libraries, frameworks, tools, or any other module that your code relies on to function correctly.

                        In the package.json file, dependencies consist of all the packages used in the project with the version number. By specifying 
                        these dependencies in the package.json file, you can ensure that anyone who downloads or clones your project has all the 
                        necessary packages and dependencies installed. When you uninstall an NPM package, you also remove the package from the dependencies

                        NPM scripts are commands that can be run in the terminal to initiate an action. Defining these terminal commands in your package.json 
                        file can help automate the process. This is done by making a field called “scripts” and adding entries that detail the command name and 
                        subsequent action to be performed. Development tasks are often repetitive, so being able to duplicate them across projects or be cloned 
                        by other developers is important. The “introduction to npm scripts” article published by GeeksforGeeks explains that “NPM scripts are 
                        used to automate tasks like minifying CSS, uglifying JavaScript, building project.

                        NPM scripts are versatile and simple and by learning fewer tools, we can automate tasks in our web project.” When writing your entries 
                        in the scripts field, its best to stick to traditional terms for commands that perform universal actions. By this we mean tasks that are 
                        routine and standardized. Its import to use commonly recognized terms because other developers kind use them more intuitively; additionally, 
                        devOps and instrumentation tools are better utilized with consistent script names. Note: If you make a default package.json file, then the 
                        scripts field will be automatically populated with the necessary scripts needed, but you will need to adjust the details of their actions for your project.

                        Running your scripts is done through the terminal, and can be done by entering
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>

                        You can run commands for testing, launching, or displaying content but can also nest commands within each other. 
                        For example, the following entry defines the ‘start’ command as another command to run “lite”.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="green_type">
                            “scripts”:<br>
                                “start”: “npm run lite”,<br>
                                “lite”: “lite-server”<br>   
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        So you could run the command “lite” by entering “npm start” in the terminal.
