    <h1>Understanding NPM and Managing Packages</h1>
    <h2>Create and Manage a package.json File</h2>
        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>Before creating a package.json file, there are a few things you need to install.</p>
        <p>A Node version manager</p>
        <p>Node.js</p>
        <p>npm</p>
        <h3>Installation</h3>
        <p>Together, npm is installed with Node.js, which means you have to install Node.js to get npm 
            installed on your computer.</p>
        <p>Node version managers allow you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm on your system.</p>
        <p>Before installing Node.js and npm, you should install a Node version manager. The standard is <a href ="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a>.</p>
        <p>You can download Node.js from the official web site <a href ="https://nodejs.org">https://nodejs.org</a>, which also has instructions to run the install.</p>
        <p>To get started with npm, <a href ="https://www.npmjs.com/signup">create an account</a>.</p>
        <p>After you set up an npm account, use the command line interface (CLI) to install npm.</p>
        <p>Run the following command to download the latest version:</p>
            <p>npm install -g npm</p>
        <p>You can check your version of Node.js and npm by typing in the commands:</p>
            <p>node -v</p>
            <p>npm -v</p>
    <h1>Install, Update, and Remove Packages</h1>
    <p>Something about section</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If you have not already, <a href ="https://www.npmjs.com/">create an npm account</a>.</li>
                <li>Search for specific packages in the top search bar. Also in the center you can click 
                    on one of the categories below Popular libraries or Discover packages.</li>
                <li>After you have clicked on the package you want, copy the package name on the far right of the page under Install.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the command line and type npm install [package_name]. </li>
                <li>If you are installing a scoped package, reference the scope name during installation. (ex. npm install [@scope/package-name]).</li>
            </ol>
    <h1>Understanding and Managing Dependencies</h1>
    <p>A dependency is a relationship between two pieces of software where one piece of software relies on the other to function properly. 
        Use dependencies to define the external packages or modules that your project needs to run properly. These external packages can 
        be libraries, frameworks, tools, or any other module that your code relies on to function correctly. In the package.json file, 
        there is an object called dependencies and it consists of all the packages that are used in the project with its version number. 
        By specifying these dependencies in the package.json file, you can ensure that anyone who downloads or clones your project has all 
        the necessary packages and dependencies installed. </p>
