                    This page introduces the basics of what Node Package Manager (NPM) and React hosting are, why 
                    they are important, and how they integrate into the MongoDB, Express, React, Node (MERN) stack. 
                    In understanding what NPM is, you can begin installing, updating, and removing packages. When 
                    managing packages, you need to manage the dependencies associated with the packages. The 
                    information below guides you in familiarizing yourself with the procedures.

                            NPM makes it easier for JavaScript developers (devs) to share code they've created and 
                            for other devs to use in their own applications. With NPM, it is also easier to see any 
                            changes and updates that have been made. You can reuse code from other devs and share 
                            your own code while managing the different versions.

                            As the name states, NPM serves as a package manager for the programming language JavaScript, and 
                            is the default package manager for Node.js. NPM allows you to install and manage packages, or 
                            collections of code written by other devs, that you can easily reuse in your own projects.

                            <!-- Updated the paragraph -->
                            React, a JavaScript library, is used to create user interfaces particularly for web applications. 
                            Developed by Facebook, React helps in efficiently updating and rendering components in response to 
                            changing data, making it the best for creating interactive and dynamic User Interfaces (UIs). <br><br>

                            One of the key features of React is its component-based architecture, which allows you to build 
                            encapsulated UI elements to integrate and form complex interfaces. Additionally, React uses a virtual 
                            Document Object Model (DOM) for efficient rendering, rather than directly manipulating the real DOM, 
                            which can consume many resources. <br><br>
                            
                            React encourages declarative programming, which means you can write to declare how the UI should look 
                            based on the application's state, rather than writing actual steps for updating the UI. Declarative 
                            programming makes code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.<br><br>
                            
                            React also has an extensive ecosystem of supporting tools and libraries: 
                            <ul id="bulletlist">
                                <li>React Router is used for navigation management</li> 
                                <li>Redux maintains application state</li>

                        <p>
                            With its speediness, flexibility, and friendliness among developers, react has become one of the 
                            most popular web application development tools in modern times.

                        Together, NPM is installed with Node.js, which means you have to install Node.js to get NPM 
                        installed on your computer. Node version managers allow you to install and switch between 
                        multiple versions of Node.js and NPM on your system. Before installing Node.js and NPM, 
                        you should install a Node version manager. The standard is <a href ="https://github.com/creationix/nvm" target="_blank">nvm</a>.
                        You can download Node.js from the official web site <a href ="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org</a>, 
                        which also has instructions to run the install.

                        A dependency is a relationship between two pieces of software where one piece of software relies on the other to function properly. 
                        Use dependencies to define the external packages or modules that your project needs to run properly. These external packages can 
                        be libraries, frameworks, tools, or any other module that your code relies on to function correctly.

                    <p>
                        In the package.json file, dependencies consist of all the packages used in the project with the version number. By specifying 
                        these dependencies in the package.json file, you can ensure that anyone who downloads or clones your project has all the 
                        necessary packages and dependencies installed. When you uninstall an NPM package, you also remove the package from the dependencies

                        NPM scripts are commands that can be run in the terminal to initiate an action. Defining these terminal commands in your package.json 
                        file can help automate the process. This is done by making a field called “scripts” and adding entries that detail the command name and 
                        subsequent action to be performed. Development tasks are often repetitive, so being able to duplicate them across projects or be cloned 
                        by other developers is important. The “introduction to npm scripts” article published by GeeksforGeeks explains that “NPM scripts are 
                        used to automate tasks like minifying CSS, uglifying JavaScript, building project.

                    <p>
                        NPM scripts are versatile and simple and by learning fewer tools, we can automate tasks in our web project.” When writing your entries 
                        in the scripts field, its best to stick to traditional terms for commands that perform universal actions. By this we mean tasks that are 
                        routine and standardized. Its import to use commonly recognized terms because other developers kind use them more intuitively; additionally, 
                        devOps and instrumentation tools are better utilized with consistent script names. Note: If you make a default package.json file, then the 
                        scripts field will be automatically populated with the necessary scripts needed, but you will need to adjust the details of their actions for your project.

                        Publishing a React project is not different from regular projects in terms of fundamentals, but there are key differences in
                        how you prepare and deploy the application.
                    </p>

                            <span class="list_headings">Build Process</span><br>
                             React applications typically require a build step before deployment. This involves transpiling JSX, bundling JavaScript files, optimizing assets, and generating static HTML files. Regular hosting may not require such a build process if you're deploying simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                            <span class="list_headings">Routing</span><br>
                            React applications often use client-side routing libraries like React Router, which rely on browser history APIs and require special server configurations to handle routes correctly. Regular hosting may not support client-side routing out of the box and may require additional server-side configurations to ensure proper routing.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                            <span class="list_headings">Asset Handling</span><br>
                            React applications generate optimized asset files (such as JavaScript bundles, CSS files, and image assets) during the build process. Hosting platforms for React applications should be capable of serving these optimized assets efficiently, often leveraging Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for fast content delivery.
                        </li>

                            <span class="list_headings">Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</span><br>
                            React applications can benefit from server-side rendering for improved SEO, performance, and initial page load times. Hosting platforms for React may offer specific support or optimizations for server-side rendering, whereas regular hosting may not provide such features out of the box.

                            <span class="list_headings">Environment Variables</span><br>
                            React applications often use environment variables for configuration (e.g., API keys, server URLs). Hosting platforms for React should provide ways to securely manage and inject environment variables into the application during the build or deployment process.

                            <span class="list_headings">Deployment Workflow</span><br>
                            React hosting platforms often offer streamlined deployment workflows tailored to React applications, such as integration with version control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) for automatic deployments, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and one-click deployment options. Regular hosting may not provide these specialized deployment workflows for React applications.

                        <p>
                            Deploying a React app involves making it accessible on the internet for users to interact with. This process 
                            typically includes steps like preparing the app for production, selecting a hosting provider, uploading the 
                            app files to the server, configuring domain and SSL settings, and ensuring ongoing monitoring and maintenance. 
                            Deploying ensures that your React app is live and available for use by your intended audience. <br>
